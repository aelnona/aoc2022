Advent of Code 2022

I'll be using whatever languages I feel like. Most of my solutions will be quite rushed, but should at least work (which is the important part obviously). I'm currently not that experienced with programming, so please put up with poor practices or weird formatting :)

This repo is more a record of my solutions than anything else. Hopefully it will be useful to me or my future self, or anyone else who somehow ended up here? 

N.B: Folxishi is an old account that I had, that apparently my laptop was using to create commits. I can't access it anymore since I lost the 2fa codes, so seeing it create commits was like seeing the ghost of Christmas past haunting me for losing my accounts :p
